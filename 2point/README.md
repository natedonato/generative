# Two Point Perspective

This project uses the traditional drawing technique of [two point perpectve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perspective_(graphical)#Two-point_perspective) combined with a generative HTML canvas design to render an endless stream of uniquely designed cubes.

In this mini web app, three dimensional images of cubes are generated on demand.  Using linear projections from 2 randomly selected vanishing points combined strategically with vertical projections and a little math to calculate the appropriate coordinates for visible faces and edges, an endless stream of unique and sometimes unexpected cubes can be rendered in a variety user of configurable styles.

The two point perspective drawing technique is traditionally easily achieveable by pen andpaper combined with a ruler or straightedge.  By adapting the techique for web and adding interactable / adjustable controls we create a new creative and expressive experience where users can produce their own unique visuals and 3 dimensional projections on every generation.
