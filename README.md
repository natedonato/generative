# Two Point Perspective

This project uses the traditional drawing technique of [two point perpectve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perspective_(graphical)#Two-point_perspective) combined with a generative HTML canvas design to render an endless stream of uniquely designed cubes.

The cubes are generated using linear projections from 2 randomly selected vanishing points, combined strategically with vertical projections and a little math to calculate the appropriate coordinates for visible faces and edges.  The technique is traditionally easily achieveable by pen andpaper combined with a ruler or straightedge.

By digitizing the techique and adding interactable / adjustable controls we create a new creative experience producing unique results on every generation.
